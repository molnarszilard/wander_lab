Using wander lab with jetbot

Welcome to the 2nd Laboratory of EFAC.
This repository is a supplimentary material for this lab: https://sites.google.com/view/utcn-efac/labs/lab2

Here you can find the scripts for the solution of this lab.
For the main part of the lab, you need to use the simulator as it is described in the documentation.

The addition of the repo is that you can try out the code in real life using a Jetbot with a Jetson Nano.

Starting the camera (from the catkin ws of the pico zense camera, T1, T2 source devel/setup.bash, T3 no source)

T1: roslaunch pico_zense_camera pz_camera.launch
T2: roslaunch pico_zense_camera camera_node_depth_image_proc.launch

T3: cd src/pico_zense_camera/launch && roslaunch pico_zense_camera depth_laser_scan.launch

T4: cd wander_lab/src/ && python wander_jetson.py

 (if you don't have the package for the pico zense, then clone it from: https://github.com/molnarszilard/pico_zense_camera)
 (if you are running it on jetson, inside the pico_zense_camera/src/pico_zense_camera/lib/ overwrite the files with the files from the zip there)
 (the depthimage_to_laserscan wont work from git on jetson, install it by apt. Then WITHOUT source devel/setup.bash, roslaunch depth_laser_scan.launch from the launch folder)
 (the pico zense camera is very instable on jetson. so far the only way to use it was to plug in both the camera and the jetson into wall)
